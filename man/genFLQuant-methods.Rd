\usage{
genFLQuant(object, ...)

\S4method{genFLQuant}{FLQuant}(object, cv = 0.2, method = "ac",
  niter = 250)

\S4method{genFLQuant}{submodel}(object, type = c("link", "response"),
  nsim = 0, seed = NULL)

\S4method{genFLQuant}{submodels}(object, type = c("link", "response"),
  nsim = 0, seed = NULL)

\S4method{genFLQuant}{a4aStkParams}(object, type = c("link", "response"),
  nsim = 0, seed = NULL, simulate.recruitment = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an FLQuant}

\item{...}{additional argument list that might not ever be used.}

\item{cv}{the coefficient of variation}

\item{method}{the method used to compute the correlation matrix; for now only "ac" (autocorrelation) is implemented}

\item{niter}{the number of iterations to be generated}

\item{type}{the type of output required. The default is on the scale of the linear predictors (link); 
the alternative "response" is on the scale of the response variable. 
Thus for a model on the log scale the default predictions are of log F (for example) 
and type = "response" gives the predicted F.}

\item{nsim}{the number of iterations to simulate, if nsim = 0, then deterministic values are returned
based on the coefficients.  If nsim > 0 then coefficients are simluated using the
covariance slot and distribution slot.}

\item{seed}{if supplied the random numbers are generate with a fixed seed for repeatablility}

\item{simulate.recruitment}{if FALSE (default) recruitment is simulated from
the recruitment estimates of recruitment, which may or may not be based on a stock-recruit
model in the origional fit.  If TRUE, then new recruitments are simulated based on the 
stock recruitment model and supplied CV used in the fit, rsulting in a completly different
timeseries of N and Catches.}

an FLQuant
}
\description{
This method uses the quant log-correlation matrix of the \code{FLQuant} object and generates a new \code{FLQuant} using a lognormal multivariate distribution.
